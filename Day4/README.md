Today, I took a break from coding and focused on something equally important—documenting my learnings so far. Instead of jumping into another project, I spent the day crafting a detailed Web Scraping Basics Cheat Sheet and uploading it to Medium.

This cheat sheet covers everything I’ve learned over the past few days, from understanding HTML structure to using powerful tools like requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. It’s designed to be a comprehensive guide for anyone starting their web scraping journey.

I wrote this article to reinforce my own understanding while creating something valuable for the community. It wasn’t just about sharing knowledge—it was about organizing it in a way that’s simple, engaging, and practical.

Day 4 reminded me that documenting your learning is as important as the learning itself. You don’t just grow as a learner; you also help others who might be on the same path. Check it out on Medium and let me know what you think!
